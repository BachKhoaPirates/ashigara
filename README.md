Ashigara is a website for review shoes. Allow you to:

* Get shoe information

* Get shoe review from user

* Get **exactly** shoe size base on foot size

* Get list of shops where sell a specific shoe

# Getting started

Install [Rails (also Ruby and PostgreSQL)](https://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu/17.04)

Then run:
`$ bundle install`
`$ rails db:create`
`$ rails db:migrate`

# How to contribute
* Fork the project.

* Run bundle

* Run bundle exec rake

* Make your feature addition or bug fix.

* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.

* Run bundle exec rake (No, REALLY :))

* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself in another branch so I can ignore when I pull)

* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
